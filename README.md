# Predict virus and host interactions based on pre-trained transformer model and attention-based multiple instances learning

### Abstract:
Detecting virus-host interactions is essential for us to understand interaction mechanisms between virus and host and explore clues regarding diseases caused by viruses. However, host information of the majority of viruses are unknown. The virus mimics the host's patterns for escaping the immune response, viruses might contain features that are related with virus-host interactions. We introduce PreTLM-MIL, extracting protein features by a pre-trained transformer model, then applying attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) to predict hosts and calculate weight of each protein, which can be used to explain key proteins associated with hosts.
